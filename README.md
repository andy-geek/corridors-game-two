# Corridors Game Two
## Description
**Corridors** is a network game for two players, where each takes turns drawing horizontal or vertical lines on the grid. A player who successfully encloses a cell marks it with a symbol ('X' or 'O') and earns an extra turn. The game ends when all cells are filled, and the player with the most enclosed cells wins.
